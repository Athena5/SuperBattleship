# SuperBattleship
Functional user interface for Battleship-based game. Clicking on a gameboard square during a turn will fire at the square and change the grid's color. Alternatively, moving or rotating a ship using the panel on the side will cause its location on the grid to update. Fired shots also disappear after a certain number of turns.

SBConstants.js file was provided beforehand.
